   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to luther's documentation!
==================================

*luther* is a lightweight, simple, and easily configurable, customizable, and extendable open source REST API for 
performing dynamic DNS operations utilizing flask, dnspython, and redis that aims to be extremely easy to both use 
and administer.

.. note::
   This documentation is nowhere near complete. I've tried to provide easy to follow documentation for setting up *luther*, 
   but all internal methods may not be documented, variables may not be well named. Eventually this won't be the case but 
   keep this in mind at this point in time.
